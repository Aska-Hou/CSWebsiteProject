# CSWebsiteProject

### This is the source code of wku computer science department official website. If you are interested in the future iteration or the deployment, welcome to fork it.
#### The whole project is based on JSP technique but it can be modified to the separation of the front end and back end model. Back end Code is based on traditional SSM (Spring, Spring MVC, and MyBatis Framework) and the Front End code is based on the HTML, CSS, and JQuery of JS. Database is MySQL.
#### Some Figures do not put on the public repository because of the secret requirement. If you are interested in this project, please contact me for the deployed version on my own server.

### Any Question, welcome to touch yueranh@kean.edu for help.
