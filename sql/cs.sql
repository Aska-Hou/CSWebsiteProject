His Ph.D. major was molecular cell biology, but he took a lot of computer courses by himself, and finally got a master\'s degree in computer science. He said that many courses in computer science require a lot of work, and he also said that he understands the hard work of computer students. He felt a lot of pressure while studying with graduate students from well-known universities such as Tsinghua, Peking University, Jiaotong University and other computer science classes, and spent a lot of sleepless nights to complete his degree in computer science. He confessed that he had found that all four major questions had no ideas in an important examination of the most challenging algorithm course, and if this compulsory algorithm course, which is only offered once a year, failed, he would lose his full scholarship. \r\n\r\nAnd postpone one year. This also means that he will interrupt his study and life in the United States, and he stood up nervously and wanted to give up the exam. But when he saw that those academic masters who came from a class had been stubbornly insisting, he said to himself, \"I can do what others can do.\" It is this kind of thinking that has always encouraged him, and in the end he got the same results as those of Tsinghua and Peking University in his class.\r\n\r\nThat was the only one of his grades that was not an A when he was studying in the United States for a master\'s and doctoral degree, but it was the subject he learned the most, grew the most, and mastered the most knowledge. He said that \"only through difficulties and setbacks can we truly grow.\" There are some difficulties in front of you that you find it difficult to overcome, but after passing through these difficult times and breaking through the siege under pressure, you will find that the baptism of this difficult time is the most precious wealth of future career and life. President Yang said frankly that his study path and scientific research work during his Ph.D. study were not all smooth sailing. There were many setbacks and failures in the experiment, but he always maintained an optimistic attitude and perseverance. \"Destiny will make fun of you. If you are wrong, you will be wrong, and you will start over if you are wrong.\" Such a mentality is even more a kind of courage and confidence to challenge difficulties.\r\n\r\nSecondly, President Yang also introduced several buildings under construction by Winken. Several plans have been designed for the comprehensive laboratory building. What difficulties have been encountered during the construction process? The reason for the long construction period is our excellence in the design and quality of the building. He shared them one by one with his classmates, and he has an affinity.\r\n\r\nFinally, he kept reminding students not to slacken their studies. In particular, students in the computer science department must not indulge in games. Adults are responsible for their actions and future prospects. Another important issue is to observe academic integrity, which is the point that every professor constantly emphasizes. I believe that the students must have new insights after attending this meeting with the principals, and they will also have more positive motivation to face the heavy academic pressure. I wish every student can achieve ideal results in the exam week, \"You don\'t make a donation. You are good.\"','2020-09-19','Zimeng Yu','On the evening of September 29th, WKU’s “net celebrity” Eric Yang, President Yang, shared a lot of his study abroad experience with the students of the Polytechnic Institute at CBPM C135 and the students put forward some suggestions on study and life.','NewsImg/ea5ecb29-a786-485f-88a8-535d9b3bbab4.png'),(25,'On this express train to the field of big data, WKUers get on the train!','At 9:00 am, the Semir Hall of the Business School was full of seats.

Tang','2017-12-25','Research Article','.Joint attention skills, broadly speaking, refer to the ability to share experiences and interests about objects and events with others in a social environment. Due to their impairment in joint attention skills, children with autism are usually facing communication challenges, for example, being reluctant to socialize and share items with others. Previous research, aiming to enhance and promote collaboration among children in this population, had designed collaborative games for children to share a single workspace with highly coupled collaborative tasks, which thus could result in forced collaboration and reduce game playability. To address this issue, we design a collaborative puzzle game to indirectly foster players’ collaboration and proactive interaction, to train their joint attention skills gradually. The application is different from previous ones in two aspects: (a) It supports loosely coupled collaboration between two players and (b) it focuses on measuring/promoting the joint attention skills among players. Specifically, some puzzle pieces of a player will be systematically put in another player’s workspace, and they are expected to notice and share them with the other player to complete the whole game. In addition, the game complexity can also be adaptively adjusted according to the players’ playing behavior.','https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0735633117745160'),(13,'A Multi-User Tabletop Application to Train Children with Autism Social Attention Coordination Skills without Forcing Eye-Gaze Following','Pinata Winoto，Tiffany Y. Tang','2017-06-01','2017 ACM Conference','Social attention coordination skills are central to the overall joint attention development. Previous research for children with neurotypical developing (NT) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has largely focused on one pathway of coordinating visual attention via gaze following with a social partner. However given the much higher reluctance of individuals with ASD to make eye contact, other pathways of visual attention coordination might be more satisfying. Such a possible pathway might be the hand-eye coordination which was observed to lead to successful social attention coordination between physically active infants and their parents. Motivated by prior works on the benefits of tabletop-based applications for ASD children, in this paper, we unfold a multi-user tabletop pattern-matching game to train ASD children social attention coordination skills via hand-eye coupling, that is, manipulation of screen-objects (puzzles with different patterns) in goal-directed tasks is achieved by alternating eye-gaze between screen-objects in one\'s own private space and another one in a shared space.','https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317920684_A_Multi-User_Tabletop_Application_to_Train_Children_with_Autism_Social_Attention_Coordination_Skills_without_Forcing_Eye-Gaze_Following'),(14,'Information Revelation for Better or Worse Recommendation: Understanding Chinese Users’ Privacy Attitudes and Practices','Tiffany Y. Tang','2015-06-11','International Conference on Web-Age Information Management','The performance of a Recommendation System (RS) is mainly determined by how well it ‘understands’ its users: how much information it is able to trace and obtain. The former is largely depended on the algorithmic designs of the recommendation which have been explored for over a decade, while the former is more and more determined by the data owners—the users. In this paper, we presented our study on understanding Chinese users’ information revelation attitudes and practices which has not been fully explored in both the recommendation and online privacy research fields. Specifically, unlike the majority of previous studies that revealed users’ self-disclosure practices and attitudes in SNSs, our study is the first and only an initial investigation into the two aspects of the personal information disclosure and sharing: the differences of personal information shared by and with different types of audiences. Our study revealed that among the five types of recipient’s, students placed the least trust on Advertisers, among four other groups as Close Friends and Family, University Community, Friends on the Social Networking Sites, and Complete (online) Strangers. Overall, students feel more comfortable actively sharing personal information with the types of audiences than being shared by these audiences of their personal details.','https://www.researchgate.net/publication/300334353_Information_Revelation_for_Better_or_Worse_Recommendation_Understanding_Chinese_Users\'_Privacy_Attitudes_and_Practices'),(15,'Missing the Point(er): On the Effectiveness of Code Pointer Integrity','Tiffany Tang.','2015-05-17','2015 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy','Memory corruption attacks continue to be a major vector of attack for compromising modern systems. Numerous defenses have been proposed against memory corruption attacks, but they all have their limitations and weaknesses. Stronger defenses such as complete memory safety for legacy languages (C/C++) incur a large overhead, while weaker ones such as practical control flow integrity have been shown to be ineffective. A recent technique called code pointer integrity (CPI) promises to balance security and performance by focusing memory safety on code pointers thus preventing most control-hijacking attacks while maintaining low overhead. CPI protects access to code pointers by storing them in a safe region that is protected by instruction level isolation. On x86-32, this isolation is enforced by hardware, on x86-64 and ARM, isolation is enforced by information hiding.

To bridge this gap, this article provides a detailed analysis of consortium blockchains, in terms of architectures, technological components and applications. In particular, the underlying consensus algorithms are analyzed in details, and a general taxonomy is discussed. Then, a practical case study that focuses on the consortium blockchain technology Ethermint is performed in order to highlight its main advantages and limitations. Finally, various research challenges and opportunities are discussed...','https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&cluster=7688247691266523706&btnI=1&hl=en'),(24,'Lightweight Secure Message Delivery for E2E S2S Communication in the IoT-Cloud System','Hemn Barzan Abdalla','2020-12-01','IEEE Access','The continuous increase in the use of smart devices and the need for E2E smart2smart (S2S) services in IoT systems play effective and contemporary roles in the field of communication, and a large amount of resources is required. Thus, IoTs and cloud computing must be integrated. One of the results of this integration is the increase in the number of attacks and vulnerabilities in the E2E S2S message delivery service of such an IoT-cloud system. However, none of the traditional security solutions can be sufficiently regarded as a secure and lightweight mechanism for ensuring that the security requirements for E2E S2S message transmission in the IoT-cloud system are fulfilled. This work aims to provide an efficient and secure, lightweight E2E S2S message delivery function, which includes the E2E S2S secure key and biometric parameter exchange function, a bio-shared parameter and bio-key generation function …','https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&cluster=13798922163146735817&btnI=1&hl=en');
